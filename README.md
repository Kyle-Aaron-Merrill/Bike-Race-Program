# Bike Race Program
 The Cycling Wave Organizer is a Python program designed to efficiently organize a group of cyclists into waves for a cycling event. The program takes into account various criteria such as rider experience level, bike type, and gender to create waves that provide an enjoyable experience for all participants.  Features:  Dynamic Wave Formation: The program dynamically forms waves based on the participants' weekly pace, ensuring that riders with similar experience levels are grouped together.  Wave Size Limit: Each wave is designed to have a maximum size of 4 riders, ensuring that the event remains manageable and safe.  Detailed Output: The program provides a clear and detailed output, displaying each wave along with the participants in that wave, making it easy for event organizers to implement.  Customizable: The code is easily customizable to accommodate different event requirements and criteria for wave formation.  Usage:  Provide a list of participants with their relevant details such as name, weekly pace, average pace, bike type, and gender.  Run the Python program to organize the participants into waves based on their criteria.  The program will generate a well-structured output, displaying each wave and its riders for event planning.  Why Use This Program:  Efficiency: The Cycling Wave Organizer eliminates the manual effort required for wave organization, saving time and ensuring fair grouping.  Optimized Experience: By grouping riders with similar experience levels and matching criteria, the program enhances the overall event experience.  Scalable: Whether it's a small local ride or a larger cycling event, this program can be adapted to suit different scales of events.  Flexibility: Event organizers can easily modify the code to include additional criteria or adjust wave size limits to meet specific event needs.
